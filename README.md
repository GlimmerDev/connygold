# ConnyGold

This is a disassembly of Pokémon ConnyGold, a hack created for the Temporarily Unnamed Discord Server after the (moderate) success of Twitter Plays Pokemon. Since the bot being used does not support GBC, Gold was chosen over Crystal. That means that this hack can be played even on an original GameBoy.

This gave me some opportunity to backport features from Crystal, such as the playing as Kris, that were never available pre-GBC. Besides quality of life changes, the hack has minor in-jokes and references to the 
TPP playthrough peppered throughout.

## Story
Three years after the events of Twitter Plays Pokémon, trainer Cnstntn has gone into seclusion. Team Rocket, disbanded due to his efforts, has splintered into a Jumbo-worshiping cult called Team Jumbo. They plan to use radio waves to turn all the Pidgey in Johto against their trainers, including the eight Pidgey given to the region's gym leaders.

The player, coincidentally starting their journey through Johto, runs into Team Jumbo in the middle of their efforts. It is up to you to stop them before they succeed!

It was revealed after defeating Team Jumbo and beating the Champion Lance, that Jumbo has also infiltrated the eight Kanto gyms.
